// What kind of turn this is, decided in one place.
//
// The local model answers anything put to it with the same assurance, right or
// wrong, and does not reliably reach for a tool when told to. So before it
// answers, a narrow call sorts what the user said, and the daemon acts on the
// result: looks things up, works out the sum, consults the Oracle, picks a
// lapsed conversation back up. This replaced lists of phrases ("my calendar",
// "who won", "try again"), each of which knew only the wordings it had been
// taught. tests/sorting.json holds the wordings this must get right; a change
// to the instructions below is checked against all of them with
// `node tests/sort.mjs` before it is trusted.
